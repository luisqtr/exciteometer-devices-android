# exciteometer-devices-android

This repository is part of a larger project: [Excite-O-Meter](https://github.com/luisqtr/exciteometer).

The Excite-O-Meter is a user-friendly Unity plugin for XR creators to integrate physiological user information in the development and evaluation of XR content. Specifically, it allows to record, analyze, and visualize validated metrics of heart activity from the chest strap sensor Polar H10 and movement trajectories from VR headsets.

This Android application is in charge of capturing data from the sensor via bluetooth and transforming the data stream to [LSL](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer) protocol.
